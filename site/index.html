  <h2>Community Rules</h2>
  <p>The best way to encourage learning and professional growth is to ensure
  it's safe to make mistakes. To that end:</p>
  </header>
  <main>
  {% for rule in site.categories.rules %}
    <article>
      <header>
        <h3>{{ rule.title }}</h3>
      </header>
      <main>
        {{ rule.excerpt }}
      </main>
    </article>
  {% endfor %}
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>We recognize that everyone makes mistake. We are <strong>forgiving, but
      not lenient</strong>. Repeated abuse of these rules will result in
    expulsion from the community.</p>
